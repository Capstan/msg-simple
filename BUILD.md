## Preamble

All instructions in this file use the Linux (or other Unix) conventions for
build. If you happen to use Windows, replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat`.

## Building instructions

### Gradle usage

You may be fortunate enough that your IDE has Gradle support. Should it not
be the case, first report a bug to your vendor; then refer to the cheat sheet
below:

```
# List the list of tasks
./gradlew tasks
# Build, test the package
./gradlew clean test
# Build a full jar -- will be generated in build/libs/*-full.jar
./gradlew clean fatjar
```

If you try and play around with Gradle configuration files, in order to be
_really sure_ that your modifications are accounted for, add the
`--recompile-scripts` option before the task name; for instance:

```
./gradlew --recompile-scripts test
```

## Important note to Maven users

While there exists a possiblity to generate a `pom.xml` (using `./gradlew pom`),
such a pom.xml will not work reliably because of the dependency of this package
on the correct generation of META-INF/services/ files. See legacy/pom.xml for
details.

While you can adapt this file to work for you, please be aware that it is _not_
supported by the author anymore.
